# HawkTUI Demos

This directory contains VHS tape files for recording animated GIF demos of HawkTUI examples.

**Note:** Demo GIFs are automatically generated by GitHub Actions CI when changes are pushed to the main branch. You don't need to generate them manually unless you want to preview changes locally.

## About VHS

[VHS](https://github.com/charmbracelet/vhs) is a tool for generating terminal GIFs from code. It allows you to write "tape files" that script terminal interactions and automatically record them as GIFs.

## Automatic Generation (CI)

The demo GIFs are automatically generated by the [Generate VHS Demos](.github/workflows/generate-demos.yml) GitHub Actions workflow when:
- Changes are pushed to `main` branch
- Tape files or examples are modified
- Manually triggered via workflow dispatch

The workflow installs VHS, ttyd, and ffmpeg, then runs all tape files to generate the GIFs.

## Manual Generation (Local)

If you want to generate the demos locally, first install VHS and its dependencies:

```bash
# Using Go
go install github.com/charmbracelet/vhs@latest

# Using Homebrew (macOS/Linux)
brew install vhs

# Using apt (Debian/Ubuntu)
sudo apt install vhs
```

VHS also requires [ttyd](https://github.com/tsl0922/ttyd) and [ffmpeg](https://ffmpeg.org/) to be installed.

## Pre-generated Demos

The demo GIF files are committed to the repository so they display in the main README on GitHub. You can view them directly in the [main README](../README.md#demos).

## Regenerating Demos

If you want to regenerate the demo GIFs (e.g., after modifying the examples or tape files):

```bash
# Generate individual demos
vhs demos/simple_demo.tape
vhs demos/dashboard_demo.tape
vhs demos/form_demo.tape
vhs demos/list_demo.tape

# Or use the provided script
./demos/generate_all.sh
```

- `Set FontSize` - Adjust font size (default: 18-20)
- `Set Width` - Terminal width in pixels (default: 1400-1600)
- `Set Height` - Terminal height in pixels (default: 900-1000)
- `Set Theme` - Color theme (e.g., "Dracula", "Nord", "Catppuccin Mocha")
- `Set TypingSpeed` - How fast to "type" commands
- `Set PlaybackSpeed` - Overall playback speed
