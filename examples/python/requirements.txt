# Hawk TUI Python Client - Requirements
#
# This file specifies the dependencies for the Hawk TUI Python client library.
# The library is designed to have minimal dependencies to reduce friction.

# Core dependencies (none required - the library is standalone)
# The hawk.py module has zero external dependencies by design

# Optional dependencies for examples and advanced features
# Install with: pip install -r requirements.txt

# For Flask demo and web integration
flask>=1.0.0

# For advanced HTTP features (optional)
requests>=2.20.0

# Development dependencies (optional)
# Uncomment these for development work:

# Testing
# pytest>=6.0.0
# pytest-cov>=2.10.0
# pytest-asyncio>=0.14.0

# Code quality
# black>=21.0.0
# flake8>=3.8.0
# mypy>=0.800
# isort>=5.0.0

# Git hooks
# pre-commit>=2.10.0

# Documentation

# Note: The core hawk.py library works without ANY of these dependencies.
# They are only needed for:
# - Running the Flask demo (flask)
# - Development and testing (pytest, black, etc.)
# - Advanced features (cryptography, etc.)
# - Specific integrations (database drivers, etc.)

# Installation options:
#
# 1. Minimal install (no dependencies):
#    Just copy hawk.py to your project
#
# 2. Basic install with Flask demo:
#    pip install flask
#
# 3. Full development setup:
#    pip install -r requirements.txt
#
# 4. Production use:
#    The library has no required dependencies in production
